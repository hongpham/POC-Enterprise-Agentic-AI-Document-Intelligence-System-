# Enterprise Agentic AI Document Intelligence System

## Overview
Multi-agent system demonstrating autonomous document processing and business workflow automation using AWS Bedrock. Implements enterprise-grade agentic AI architecture patterns with advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Architecture Patterns

### Agent Broker Pattern
- Central supervisor coordinates specialized agents
- Dynamic agent selection based on task requirements
- Load balancing and resource optimization

### Supervisor Pattern
- Hierarchical task delegation and monitoring
- Multi-step workflow orchestration
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Coordinated reasoning across agent types
- Shared memory and context management
- Asynchronous message passing

## Core Agents

### 1. Supervisor Agent
```
Responsibilities: Task decomposition, agent orchestration, workflow management
Technology: Amazon Bedrock Claude, EventBridge, Step Functions
```

### 2. Document Perception Agent
```
Responsibilities: Document extraction, content classification, entity recognition
Technology: Amazon Textract, Bedrock, Comprehend
```

### 3. Analysis Agent
```
Responsibilities: Deep reasoning, compliance checking, insight generation
Technology: Amazon Bedrock, RAG with OpenSearch, DynamoDB
```

### 4. Action Agent
```
Responsibilities: Process execution, system integration, audit logging
Technology: Lambda, API Gateway, CloudTrail
```

## Memory Architecture
- **Working Memory**: Current session context (DynamoDB)
- **Episodic Memory**: Historical interactions (S3 + OpenSearch)
- **Semantic Memory**: Domain knowledge (Vector embeddings)
- **Procedural Memory**: Optimized workflows (Step Functions)

## AWS Services Stack
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Foundation models (Claude, Titan)
- **Amazon Textract**: Document processing
- **Amazon OpenSearch**: Vector search and RAG
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Agent state management
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless agent execution
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Agent communication
- **AWS Step Functions**: Workflow orchestration

## Enterprise Features
- **Security**: IAM roles, encryption, VPC isolation
- **Compliance**: Audit trails, data governance, retention policies
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling, load balancing, resource pooling
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics, X-Ray tracing, custom dashboards

## Business Use Cases
1. **Contract Intelligence**: Automated contract analysis and risk assessment
2. **Invoice Processing**: End-to-end invoice validation and approval
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated compliance checking and reporting
4. **Customer Service**: Intelligent document-based customer support

## Key Capabilities
- Autonomous multi-step task execution
- Goal-directed operation with minimal human oversight
- Advanced reasoning with memory retention
- Enterprise-grade reliability and security
- Performance evaluation and optimization

## Testing the System

After deployment, verify the system works correctly:

### Quick Verification
```bash
python3 test_deployment.py
```

### End-to-End Testing
1. Upload test document to S3 bucket
2. Trigger Step Functions workflow via AWS Console
3. Monitor execution and check results in DynamoDB

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing instructions.
